# âš¡ Energy Data Analysis Project (Power BI)

This repository contains an **Energy Consumption Dashboard** created using **Power BI Desktop**.  
The project focuses on analyzing **diesel consumption and electricity billing (EB) values** across different clusters, circles, sites, and managers. It highlights operational efficiency, usage trends, and cost distribution to support energy management strategies.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
The analysis provides insights into **cluster-wise fuel usage, monthly consumption patterns, site-level performance, and manager-wise accountability**. It also compares **diesel vs. EB values** to identify optimization opportunities, with special emphasis on **green vs. non-green sites**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- **Total Diesel Consumption**: 531.20K liters across multiple clusters  
- **Total EB Consumption**: 14.38M in value  
- **Top Clusters**: Patna and Gaya lead in EB consumption, while Gaya records the highest diesel use (164K).  
- **Manager-wise Diesel Consumption**: Afroz Alam and Dheeraj Kumar manage the largest shares.  
- **Monthly Trends**: Diesel peaks in June (73.5K), while EB values stay steady around 1.7Mâ€“2M.  
- **Site-Level Analysis**: Mahmood Chowk (309K) and BARBA (148K) are top EB consuming sites.  
- **Average Diesel Consumption**: ~101.53 liters per site, with Patna recording the lowest average.  
- **Green Sites**: 70.76% sites are green, supporting sustainable energy practices.  
- **Cluster Comparison**: Deoghar shows highest diesel average, while Patna has highest EB consumption.  

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** for visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Energy Dataset** for diesel, EB, and site-wise analysis  

## ðŸ”¹ Highlights
- Comprehensive **diesel vs. EB comparison** across clusters  
- Identification of **top energy-consuming sites and managers**  
- Clear view of **monthly trends and operational efficiency**  
- Useful for **telecom operations, energy planning, and sustainability monitoring**
